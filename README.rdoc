= Vertigo

Is the VerticalResponse API making you dizzy?

Vertigo is a simple Ruby wrapper that makes working with the VerticalResponse SOAP API much more Ruby-like.  It manages your session_id, as well as letting you write methods as launch_email_campaign rather than launchEmailCampaign, and use symbols as keys rather than strings.

== Installation

Simply add Vertigo to your Gemfile:

    gem 'vertigo'

If you are unlucky enough not to be using Bundler:

    gem install vertigo

== Usage

Basic example:

    require 'vertigo'
    
    client = Vertigo::Client.new('username', 'password', :duration_minutes => 5)

    # Launch a campaign whose ID you already know:
    client.launch_email_campaign(:campaign_id => 123456)

For more info, please see {Vertigo::Client}[http://rubydoc.info/gems/vertigo].

== Compatibility

* Written against the 2011.08.10 deploy of the VerticalResponse API "v1.0".  More information: http://developers.verticalresponse.com/api/soap/developers-reference/articles/verticalresponse-api-update-for-august-2011/

== Contributing

To set up your development environment, please run:

    bash dev-setup.sh

Among other things, that command makes sure you have run `git flow init` (which makes managing contributions easier).

When writing documentation:

    bundle exec yard server --reload
